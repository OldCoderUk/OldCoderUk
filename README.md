- 👋 Hi, I’m @OldCoderUk and I've been programming professionally since 1983, starting before MS-DOS was mainstream using the CP/M OS, moved to MS-DOS in 1984, then every version of Windows since. I have worked in a range of languages from BASIC through to Delphi and since around 2007 I have specialised in C#.
- 👀 I’m interested in hybrid applications - the power of desktop with the accessibility of the web, the best of both worlds.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can get my hands on that improves the software I am working on at the time...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects, but have limited time available due to existing commitments. I can find some time for the right things!
- 📫 You reach me via Github.
